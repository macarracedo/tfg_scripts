It started with a growth on his head but he wouldn’t go in despite our pleas. It has spread to his lymph nodes, he also has copd and congestive heart failure. \n\nMy dad is a very interesting person, and I love him very much. He was born in Germany and is a 3rd generation master shear and cutlery craftsman. He can build and fix anything, just by observing and touching it. Up until recently he would go through these phases where he gets into something really passionately. One year it was wand and walking staff making. Gold panning, rock tumbling, carving, stained glass making…you name it he’s probably done it. Every year he would watch the turtles come up to nest, and he’d collect the eggs and raise the turtles until they were strong, and release them back. He’s trained squirrels and chipmunks to do all sorts of things. He started oil painting while listening to Bob Ross. He’s built entire houses, he plays the harmonica really well. He loves bluegrass and delta blues. His eyes are crystal blue and piercing. A friend once told me he has a feral look to him. Someone else once told me he might be a wizard. Everyone says he’s a character…he loves cracking jokes and laughing. He loves coming up with stories and funny scenarios with my brother and I. He brags about winning skipbo, and always has the most smug look on his face. The only person who can ever beat him is my husband. \n\nMy dad taught me to be strong. He taught me to never half ass a job. He’s taught me to never give up, to use power tools…he never thought of me being a girl as an excuse to not show me how. He’s taught me to love snakes and lizards and bugs and all living creatures. He taught me how to swim and fish, how to grow a garden…even in his flaws I’ve learned. I’ve learned to not let grumpiness or meanness get to me, because inside that person is suffering and doesn’t know how to react. I’ve learned to stay away from alcohol and cigarettes because it catches up to you in the end. I’ve learned that being cynical about people only causes pain and frustration. My dad isn’t a good teacher, he’s impatient and takes over because in his mind he can get the job done best, but he’s usually right about that. I’ve learned from him to never miss out on an opportunity just because you’re skeptical or think you can’t do it…because no matter the outcome,  the experience itself is invaluable. \n\nDespite his flaws, my dad is a good man. A rough and gruff exterior with a heart made of goo. An innovator who can touch anything and recreate it with his hands. I’ve gotten my talent and my ability to quickly learn from him. I’ve also gotten alcoholism and frustration about people from him. I have his eye shape and his brow line \n\nDespite his diagnosis he’s in good spirits. He goes in to surgery on Tuesday and we’re all going with him. We don’t know how far it’s spread…but I keep having dreams about him and I have this feeling that he’s accepted that his time here is short. He told my brother and I not to leave our stepmom alone. He told us he’s scared to go into surgery. I’m not a bullshitter…(I got that from him) so I can’t tell him that it’s all dandy, that everything will be fine. All I can do is listen and let him know that everything will be taken care of, and that no matter what we will be by his side the whole way. I want him to know that my brother and I are strong, and that he doesn’t have to worry about us. I tell him I love him all the time. I give him hugs and kiss him, and listen to his stories and laugh at his jokes. \n\nThen I go home and cry, really hard.

But I needed to hear this tonight. \n\nTL;DR:  Don’t belittle yourself because your cancer journey may not be “that bad” in comparison. Your feelings are valid. \n\nMy cancer was found on accident during a laparoscopy and therefore caught very early. My local pathology center said it was suspicious but I’m young and healthy so it’s probably nothing. Thankfully my doctor wanted a second opinion and sent them to Johns Hopkins. A few more weeks (and a large bill) later, they basically told me it looks like cancer but they weren’t sure. So off to one of the countries best cancer treatment centers I go. 44 days of wondering and I finally get a diagnosis. Low grade peritoneal serous carcinoma in several places along with several atypical mesothelial proliferations. Oncologist #1 there says we need to do another laparoscopy. Same results from second surgery but more defined. Sends me to oncologist #2. They say I need another laparoscopy. Same results from third surgery. Not enough to diagnose me with mesothelioma, but still very suspicious. I do have cancer and I will most likely get diagnosed with another at some point. But there isn’t enough to treat with chemo or more surgery right now. 3 surgeries and 6 months later, every doctor and pathologist has told me my case is special or rare or puzzling. It’s frustrating for both them and me. \n\nI was talking with a friend who had cancer in her teens. I was telling her how I’ve been struggling, but I feel like I can’t really complain because I haven’t had to go through chemo or radiation, which she did both. It almost feels like survivors guilt and I have no place to complain or feel bad for myself because so many people have it so much worse. \n\nShe told me “Actually you have it worse.” I was confused. She said “you don’t have a diagnosis. You don’t have a treatment plan. You’re just stuck in a gray area and have been for 6 months. Yeah, I had to do chemo and radiation but they knew exactly what I had, identified the gene that caused it, and knew how to treat it. You don’t get any of that.”\n\nI was speechless. While I may not agree whole heartedly, it validated my pain and suffering. After 3 surgeries, I’m still not sure what’s going on inside of me and neither are the best doctors. They will continue to watch me and hopefully catch any new growth or spreading in time to treat it when they can identify exactly what it is. And for that I am lucky. \n\nI say this not to make less of anyone’s situation, but to say this: Cancer is scary. It sucks. It is painful. But your journey is your own and you are allowed to feel that hurt, fear, frustration, anger, and every other emotion. Don’t belittle yourself because your journey may not be “that bad” in comparison.

It progressed to stage 4 in 2020.\n\nHe had about three local recurrences in the span of his diagnosis up until 2021, plus some mets in both of his lungs that remained stable since 2020 up until now. \nHe was treated with surgery, chemo and radiation every year, having a stable period (no treatment) of about 6 months each year before the next recurrence appeared. \n \nIn September 2021 chemo stopped working and he was set to start an immunotherapy trial (dendritic cell vaccines) in February 2022. The reason for having to wait until February was that they needed a \"fresh\" tumor sample to produce the vaccines. \nAt this point his last pet scan showed the lung mets grew a bit and a small tumor in his peritoneal cavity, which remained stable, so they decide that they needed to allow the tumor in his peritoneal cavity to grow a bit in order to be able to produce the vaccines for the trial. \n\nIn December 2021 he started having sporadic gastrointestinal issues like cramps, throwing up food, etc.. Doctors attributed this as being a symptom of his multiple surgeries since these issues would solve by themselves in the next one or two days. \n\nAt the beginning of January 2022 he had surgery to remove the tumor in his peritoneal cavity and start producing the vaccines for the trial. \n\nIn January 15th he couldn\'t pass down food through his stomach and starts throwing up bile with fecal odor, gets admitted to the hospital the next day. \nThey do a colonoscopy (all clear), CT scan shows inflammation in the small bowel and they decide to feeding him through TPN and put a nasogastric tube. \nSeven days go by and he still can\'t eat, so they decide to do surgery. \n\nDuring surgery they remove three big tumors that were blocking his small intestines, however they tell us that there are lots of very small tumors all over his intestines, which they were not able to remove. At this point he, his family and I are devastated, but still have some hope on the vaccines trial. \n\nFirst four days of recovery go well, but on the fifth day when the nurses first try to move him to the shower he complains that he can\'t breathe, his oxygen levels start to drop and he gets put in oxygen support. \n\nTwo days go by and he starts developing pneumonia. They can\'t keep his oxygen levels above 91 so they decide to intubate and put him on a ventilator in the ICU. \n\nDuring the next two weeks, while intubated, multiple things start to get better: his pneumonia starts to recede, they remove the tpn, feed him through the nasogastric tube and his intestines start to work again. \n\nAfter the second week the doctors decide he still needs to be on a ventilator so they do a tracheostomy. \nDuring this week things start to get worse: he develops a fistula in his intestines and his intestines stop working, so they put him back on tpn. By this point we are told that they can\'t do anything for his intestines and he would need to be put permanently on tpn and a permanent drainage for the fistula. \n\nHe then starts having internal bleeding which requires emergency surgery. He survives the surgery and spends the next two days at the icu. On the third day they move him out of the icu and connect an oxygen concentrator to his tracheostomy. \n\nAt this point he has muscle atrophy from being bed ridden for a month and a half. He starts getting severe anxiety attacks and some days they have to sedate him heavily. \n\nA week goes by and his lungs appear to be getting better, so the doctors start looking forward to remove his tracheostomy. \n\nFour days ago he starts developing a fever and having lots of phlegm which interrupt his sleep schedule. They do bronchoscopic and blood cultures, find a bacteria and start treating him. The fever gets under control and he starts sleeping well. \n\nYesterday his oxygen levels start to decrease and they have to increase his oxygen support. At the same time his respiratory rate increases to 35-60 and the anxiety attacks start coming back. \n\nThis morning we get the news that his xray scans show he has pneumonia again and that they don\'t know if he will make it this time even if is on antibiotics for the specific bacteria that is causing his pneumonia (first one was an atypical pneumonia since the culture results didn\'t show anything). \n\nAt this point his family and I are devastated, it\'s been 2 months in the hospital of non stop suffering for my brother, and by this point, it\'s taking a toll on everyone\'s physical and mental health. \n\nI\'ve been taking care of him in the hospital from 8 pm to 8 am non stop for the last two months, excluding the two weeks he was in the icu. His sister and wife take turns to take care of him during the day. \n\nAs for me, I don\'t mind the physical stress, I had the luxury of temporarily quitting my job so that I could sleep from 9 am to 5 pm and get back to the hospital by 8pm to take care of him.\n\nHe has three children and a wife that need him. I just wanted him to get better, but at this point I know he won\'t. Even if he makes it out of his current pneumonia infection it\'s only a matter of time before the tumors in his intestines and lungs start giving him trouble again. I just wish he could die at his home surrounded by his family and not in a hospital bed, it\'s been two months since he last saw his three children.  \n\nI\'m sad because he is suffering so much. I\'m sad because of the suffering his family is going through. I\'m sad because his children are going to grow up without his dad.\nI\'m sad because a lot of people who I considered my friends didn\'t even reach out to provide emotional support in these past two months. \nWhen he dies I truly am alone, left with no real friends. \n\nI\'m so mad at life right now.

I made a post on here a couple months ago, regarding my 3rd relapse of Neuroblastoma 4 and how I’d be going through a bunch of treatment. Thankfully I’m in remission now, but I’m still going through some rough treatments. I’ve gotten a couple rounds of extremely high doses of chemotherapy, a major surgery, and currently, doing antibodies. After getting the chemotherapy, the side effects were pretty bad; but we didn’t think much of it cause it was a super high dosage. Same thing for the surgery, I had it to the left of my spine and it took about 10 hrs. \n\nI started to get super suspicious during my first round of antibodies. My oncologist had told me that most kids get through it fine. My head was stuffed up all week after and again, very nauseous. The 2nd week I was stuck in the hospital for 3 weeks and upsettingly over the holidays. I got horrible mouth sores that wouldn’t heal because my body couldn’t produce any platelets. They hurt so much that I didn’t eat at all in those weeks and lost 15lbs. \nWe’ve had to switch to a new antibody which I’m currently taking, it pretty much cramps up my entire body as i get it so I get a lot of pre-meds before, but there arnt really many side effects so that’s a plus. \n\nWith 4 times under my belt now I’m so paranoid of another relapse so I was talking to my dad about getting another round of antibody. I guess I never realized this but for pretty much every treatment I get, I have a terrible reaction to it. Much worse then what it should be. I’m not sure if it is because most of the treatments are for littler kids or because my body has been breaking down over the years of treatment. I look at myself and I have radiation and med burns, countless scars on my torso, and many other flaws. My Dad had told me that we can’t keep doing this harsh treatment because it’s killing me, even if I’m in remission now. \n\nI think this relapse has affected me the most. My last was 5 years ago when I was only 11 (currently 16). I know this sounds poorly of me compared to the rest of you on this sub, but now that I can actually make a decision on what to do, I’m so much more stressed out now. Trying to balance out treatment, health, and being a successful high school student is really taking a toll on me. I know I shouldn’t be doing this, but everytime I feel worried or depressed I just kind of… bury it down. I guess the easiest way is to just power through it, feeling sad about it won’t really help anything.\n\nAlmost all the treatments I’m getting are part of a trial, because it’s mostly the only new thing we can try, but also I hope to give my input on the treatment to the researchers so kids don’t have to go through this hell I’m in right now. \n\n I can’t really complain too much, I’ve read so many of you guy’s stories on here and it makes me feel little in comparison. I don’t really like to talk about this with my friends cause I don’t really need people worrying about me. I’d much rather spread more positivity towards them. I’m sorry this ended up being so long, I had a bit that stacked up over the months that I needed to let out. Thank you for baring with my fussy girly teen rant :)\n\nTL;DR Even though I’m in remission, my treatment is killing me.\n\n\nedit: I appreciate you guy’s comments, the trial I’m getting right now is based out of Sloan Kettering, where they probably are the best doctors in the world for my situation.

After a really long delay of over a month, with having no biopsy, and trying to connect with a doctor who could help, we found one.  He was so compassionate and action oriented, an ENT surgeon who deals with cancers.  He did a biopsy the same day in his office and referred us to see other specialists who would be part of the collaboration for excising the tumor in my mom’s hard palate, and the prosthesis/rehab after.  We rushed through a week of CT scans, prosthodontist appointment, oral maxillofacial surgeon, to try to get the details coordinated.  Today was the 1 week follow up consult, where we went over the options.  The traditional approach is surgical removal.  But because of her advanced age and these complicating factors (she would need all these surgical implants in her jaw bone to anchor the obdurator in place bc of her periodontal disease history)… her tumor is much larger now (huge as the OMS doctor said in the consult)… the doctor didn’t quite spell it out why, but caution was taken.  He told us he couldn’t do the surgery next week because the following week he was out of town.  So it couldn’t be scheduled less than 3 weeks out.  And he asked what we wanted and I explained my mom has hesitation with it being a lot to process. When he asked my mom what she wanted, she just didn’t have a coherent answer but just said he was very considerate and said she wanted the best course of action.  The obstacles ahead for recovery after surgery have sounded daunting.  With a large part of her palate coming out.  \n\nHe mentioned immunotherapy and chemotherapy to shrink the tumor with a possible outcome that it may extend her life 2 years, 5 years, one couldn’t say.  But it would be an alternative.  He suggested we get a second opinion from a medical oncologist.

I guess I’m looking for advice or different perspectives. My dad is 61 and has been battling cancer for about 6 years now. He stopped eating or drinking much last week because of the pain and ended up in the hospital from dehydration. He was hoping to come home yesterday day, but then he fell and broke his leg. I’m his power of attorney, although he’s still making his own decisions while in the hospital. His doctor called me yesterday to ask about his palliative care plan, and if he had a bed reserved in a hospice or palliative care home. I believe he does have a bed available to him at a palliative care home in town, if he needs/wants it. \n\nHis brothers and sisters (big family) are very insistent that we bring him home, and not to a palliative care home. My sibling (were both in our early twenties) also wants him home instead of hospice care. Before he was hospitalized, I know he would have said the same. If he does go home, I’m able to get him a hospital bed through insurance, and we have a few PSWs in the family. Currently he has a nurse come into his home for an hour a few days a week, and apparently we have a nurse willing to come out of retirement to help too. I’m trying to see if I get can more funding through insurance so we could get a nurse there everyday. We have a big family, so he would never be alone in the house. I’m also looking into taking family leave so I can spend more time with him, and if needed i could move into his house too. \n\nStill, I’m worried and I don’t know what the right choice is. He is in a lot of pain, there’s cancer in his bones and all of his organs at this point. The hospital has him on pain meds through iv, another iv to keep him hydrated, and oxygen. He’s taking a dose of pain meds nearly every 15 minutes in addition to his baseline dose. I don’t think he’ll ever walk again, he also has a catheter. My biggest concern right now is pain management. I’m worried that if he stays home we won’t be able to properly continue the care plan he’s had in the hospital. Since PSWs can’t administer these sort of drugs, I think we would need a full time palliative nurse in the house. I’m going to talk to our family doctor tomorrow about that, I’m not sure how realistic that would be. He sleeps a lot, and still talks to us a bit. I don’t think he’s said more than five words at once. I just know with a palliative care home he would have 24-hour care and pain meds always accessible. We would also be allowed to visit him anytime. I just want to make sure he is comfortable and in as little pain as possible. \n\nSo, I was wondering if anyone has experience with a loved one in a hospice/palliative care home or end of life care at home to share.

Stupidly I walked into my appointment believing that. When this doctor looks at me and says life expectancy is 6-12 months my heart sank.

Was told again, i had 6-12 months at max unless had surgery to remove nodes and no choice but try the radiation that I now kinda qualify for. \n\nDecember 21st I started radiation on both groins, pelvic lymph nodes, entire vulva and anus. 37 treatments, 6.5 weeks of M-F daily blasts to one of the most sensitive areas. I had to watch videos and numerous radiologist & oncologist had to warn me that this is the most painful treatment they do, it’s right under neck/mouth radiation. They legitimately put the fear into me then ended with “I wont tell you any worst, we’ll just wait and deal with if/when happens…” greeeat ????. \n\nWell I actually completed it, I didn’t think I could but I pushed an did it. It’s been 2 weeks and I regret it all ?. I wish I took my first notice and just let run its course. I’d be dead and out of this misery.

They never found anything so he only took pain killers. He drinks and smoke, and when my mom died from breast cancer about 10 years ago he started drinking and smoking even more. The pandemic was the worst time ever for him, causing him to drink too much until he passed out. I wonder if this played a bigger part. He had a very difficult early life so I can\'t get mad at him for that even though I wish he\'d pursue a healthier lifestyle.\nSince he has been diagnosed he hasn\'t been drinking at all which is great. He still smokes a bit. \n\nSo, last summer after drinking he started vomiting and was in an awful pain. My brother brought him to ER and they had to cut him off 4cm of small intestine and leave him with an open stomach with a pocket for about 2 months. He lost a lot of weight and he was already tiny way back then. After they removed the pocket he was feeling way better and was assisted to gain back weight. He was prescribed Somatuline but unfortunately it didn\'t help, the tumor has now spread to the liver so they plan to do radiotherapy. \nThese last days he sleeps a lot and complained about back pain. He had diarrhea but they prescribed him something to help with that. He\'s not eating so well so he lacks vitamins which caused him to go back to hospital. There they found out he has hepatitis (B) and probably had this for years. He was supposed to start the radiotherapy the 1st of February but they said we have to treat hepatitis first so it was delayed to the 20th. \nThis last weekend he couldn\'t eat at all for 3 day, everytime he tries to eat his body would reject it by making him puke.

It was rough. But I managed to power through it all with a smile on my face. Never really felt sorry for myself, and generally kept a rather positive attitude through the experience. \n\nI anticipated having to go through the physical trauma, but never expected to feel so much...isolation. Friends I\'ve had for 20 years basically ghosted me for months on end. Plenty of people would ask my family how I was doing, but I could count on one hand how many actually checked on me directly. My ex-wife was the only person outside of my immediate family that checked up on me when I started chemo, and that was mostly to ask questions pertaining to adopting my step-son in case of my possible death. No I\'m not shitting you, we actually had that discussion the day I started chemo lol.\n\nThe only people that were really there for me were my parents. They were the ones that took care of me when I was really sick, took me to all my appointments 90 minutes away, and made sure I didn\'t have to worry about financials while I was unable to work. They\'ve been amazing, and I\'m still living with them now even. That said, I felt like I couldn\'t talk to them about mental struggles I would have with the situation. It\'s not that they wouldn\'t be willing to listen...I just simply couldn\'t handle possibly putting them through more stress. They did a good job of not showing it, but I could still tell it was much harder on them mentally than it was on me. My dad actually had a minor heart attack 2 days after my diagnosis (he\'s ok). There\'s no way I could even think about placing any more of my burdens on them.\n\nAnd then there\'s the pleasure of getting to tell someone about your cancer. Whether it\'s someone I know that wasn\'t aware or a complete stranger; I always get \"the look\". The fucking look. I\'d best describe it as a weird combination of shock and pity. After that, the entire flow of the conversation just feels...off. It\'s almost as if they view me as an entirely different person once the word \"cancer\" leaves my lips. Now mind you, I\'m not breaking down in tears whenever I mention it; I\'m actually very nonchalant when I bring it up. But the reaction is almost always the same.\n\nWhich brings me to my next point...dating! Dating is just absolutely impossible in my situation. Granted, I\'m unattractive, balding, have 2 kids, and live with my parents...so not off to a great start. But there is just no way someone would be willing to take such a burden into their lives. And while that really sucks for me, I completely understand not wanting to get involved with someone in my situation. Outside of getting out of breath a bit easier than the average person, I seem to be perfectly healthy. But I still have that cancer lingering in my body, and it\'s almost certain to get worse at some point.\n\nI suppose this whole experience has just left me feeling jaded towards interacting with people in general. Anymore I mostly keep to myself, and don\'t even attempt to meet anyone new. And I\'m somewhat content with that. I\'m not really sad or angry, I\'ve just kinda grown numb. I still maintain a positive attitude and am perfectly nice and friendly with people. Just kinda feels like I\'m on my own from an emotional standpoint, and I\'ll have to continue to win that battle by myself.

I am 29/F. I\'ve been struggling with news of my relapse recently. My entire journey has been quite a wild ride and I didn\'t know who else to talk to. I have a wonderful support system but it\'s still challenging even with that.  \n \n\nI was diagnosed in September 2016 with classical Hodgkin\'s Lymphoma, Stage 4BX. Got 12 rounds of ABVD ending March 2017. A few weeks later, PET scan came back showing refractory disease. We decided to go ahead with an Autologous Stem Cell Transplant (ASCT) in September 2017. PET showed signs of disease in January 2018. Went down the immunotherapy route with Brentuximab Vedotin for a few months, didn\'t work out. Switched over to Nivolumab until July 2019. Found progressive disease (growing in new areas) in abdomen (I\'ve only had it above the diaphragm before this point). Panel recommended that I do an Allogenic Stem Cell Transplant (Allo SCT) with a donor. Fortunately my brother was a perfect match. He donated his cells and I had my second transplant in December of 2019. I also underwent two rounds of TBI (Total Body Irradiation) during this procedure. (Note: this was my first endeavour with radiation throughout the years).  \n I came home In March 2020, right at the time when COVID started to become a serious thing. Went to the hospital and found out after a liver biopsy and bronchoscopy (lung biopsy) that I had chronic GVHD. Had to treat that heavily with medication/steroids including Prednisone and Voricanzole.  \n Finally came off most of my meds this past May (2021). I was feeling so much better despite everything else. Bloodwork/labs came back clean and my PFTs (pulmonary function tests) looked stable.  \n Over the Christmas break, I was feeling around my clavicle and neck like I always do (does anyone else find themselves casually massaging their former areas often out of habit? haha) and found a lump. Then I found a few smaller ones when I really massaged my neck. I went to get it checked out, the bloodwork looked normal. Referred to get an ultrasound done, looked suspicious. Went in to get ultrasound biopsy done and results confirmed return of Hodgkins.  \n \n\nI was so shocked, even my medical team was at a loss. I don\'t think any of us saw this coming. Even though my history may have looked tumultuous, the Allo SCT did work until it didn\'t.  \n \n\nI was sent back to my original hematologist and she is amazing. I\'ve always appreciated her efforts and her honesty. She said that she wasn\'t sure what to do and wanted some time to discuss with her colleagues. I got news a bit later from her saying she and a panel of doctors, hema/oncologists, pathologists and radiology oncologists went over my case. Felt that the best way to go is radiation with possible targeted cell therapy (used for non-Hogkins, but not sure what success rate it is for my case).  \n \n\nI\'m so sorry for the long, bleak post but I am wondering if anyone out there went through the same or similar thing I have/am going through. I wonder if anyone knows of anything else or if radiation did work for them. Any clinical trials? I\'ve had a journey of acceptance and understanding but I\'m also not ready to go.

Him and my mom were big drinkers my whole life and I lived in fear as a child. They had a band over and one of those guys touched my sister and I...  I cried more than laughed and was scared for their safety all the time.  I in particular don\'t like my Dad because he touched me inappropriately when I was young.

I just can\'t keep doing this.  I\'m so depressed.  I\'m so sad. I feel like maybe if I just ended myself I would finally be free from suffering. I really, genuinely resent my Dad for this.

So I want to get the word out on that too! \n\nSo, I thought I would like to help answer questions if anyone has any! \n\nAsk away! \n\nMy first tumor was discovered after a series of tests couldn\'t figure out why I had a large mass that appeared to pop up overnight and was the size of a small lime in my lymph node area.  They removed the mass and sent it to pathology while on the table.  It came back positive for a cancerous lymph node so they did a partial neck dissection removing 20 nodes.  It was identified as HPV-16 positive Squamous Cell Carcinoma, which originates in the oropharyngeal area, and is most often caused by oral sex. Most people eliminate this HPV virus out of their body but for some reason some people like myself, it likes to stick around and cause cancer. \n\nAfter that, I had the Da Vinci surgical robot surgery called TORS to remove all the tissue from my oropharyngeal areas to find the primary tumor as they knew the cancer originates there.  They couldn\'t visualize it, but did find a pea-sized mass at the base of my sublingual tongue in my throat, on the same side as my neck mass. This surgery is extremely painful and I found it on a list of the 40 most painful surgeries.  However, I was on a lot of pain medication, I was able to push through and get the NG feeding tube out after a day, and I was able to eat normally gradually and fully at about 4 weeks out. \n\nNext surgery was a partial neck dissection on the other side of my neck and although we didn\'t think we would find anything in the 30 nodes removed, they did discover the teeniest of metastatic tumors, only 1.5 mm!!! \n\nBecause of the type of cancer I have, even with the two metastatic tumors, I\'m only STAGE ONE... I guess because I\'m post-op and they were already removed.  But to prevent the 30% to 40% reoccurance rate of a secondary occurrence, which has a higher death rate (it is hard to get at a reoccurance surgically), I will need radiation and chemo. \n\nBecause radiation on the oropharyngeal area can be extremely difficult and life changing with things like fragile jaw, damaged teeth, feeding tubes due to permanent swallowing issues, etc... I was only going to do the new reduced radiation  protocol in various studies around the U.S. I was very very fortunate enough to have a Dr. here doing this study, so I\'m going forward. \n\nI will have 2 weeks of radiation with 2 infusions of chemo, one at the beginning of each week.  The radiation will be 2xday for the two weeks. \n\nSo that is my H&N Cancer journey. I feel so incredibly lucky my lymph node blew up and alerted us early!!!

This time last year my husband and I headed into NYC to go to MSK\'s main hospital for the surgery that changed my life.  Around 3pm or so I finally got brought back and was given my \"2 glasses of wine\" and off to surgery I went.  \n\n  \nFebruary 9th 2021 I walked into MSK with an intact body and cancer in two organs.  After a crazy 10 hour surgery that wrapped up at 2am the following morning, I woke up sore, minus my large intestine, 60% of my liver, gallblader, apendix and cancer free but with an ileostomy and HAI pump.  I still had plenty ahead of me, recovering, getting used to my new friend Stomie the Homie and my hockey puck of lifesaving & cancer prevention called a HAI Pump. \n\n   \nOne year ago was the last day of a life that I no longer remember.  It was the last day of me going to the bathroom 25 times a day.  It was the last time I hopefully would have to worry about how far away from the bathroom am I.\n\n  \nTomorrow marks Stomie\'s one year birthday and My 1 year NED.  I can\'t believe how much that operation changed my life.  Over the course of the year I have done things that I never dreamed of doing.  \n\n  \nThe most important thing though, Make sure you get a colonoscopy.  Colon Cancer is one that is easily treated if caught early.  A few years ago they changed the recommended age for a colonoscopy to 45 down from 50.  Colonoscopies save lives.  If you are having any changes in bowel habits, blood, flat stool, etc please go to your doctor and request to be tested.  \n\n  \nIts been a crazy 1.5 years for me and my family and I hope that I have many many many more of them in a continued state of NED but I know that there are others out there that are on different parts of their journey, from just being diagnosed to winning their fight.

Thank you all for your kind words and advice.\n\n\nMy (23F) mother (58F) was diagnosed last week with stage IV metastatic brain cancer. She went for a scan to check for a stroke, and they saw 23 lesions on her brain.\n\n\nFirst, I’d like to apologize (and ask for input) if my terminology is off, I’ve read that stage 4 IS metastatic? We aren’t sure where the cancer spread from to get to her brain, or if it’s anywhere else, but I am heavily leaning towards lung originally. They did do a scan but my mother isn’t interested in the results. I’d love to know what to properly refer to it as!\n\n\nI’m unsure of what my end goal is with this post, but I have no one to talk to otherwise. I will take any advise, knowledge, similar stories, really anything at all. Please reply with anything that pops in your head at any point. \n\n\nMy mother got her diagnosis on February 2nd and left the hospital immediately. This didn’t upset me, or my brother (38M) who took her home, because our mom wants what she wants and that’s that. She also just witnessed her only brother go through this battle just over a year ago; trying every experimental drug and treatment they could possibly find. My memory is foggy on how far along he was, but every time they’d clear it it would show back up in another body part. My mom told me she couldn’t even visit him because of what those drugs did to him, he was a different person, and “already gone”. I understand why my mom hid her symptoms for this long. I’m not even angry. She got to go through however long it was just feeling “under the weather”, instead of “having cancer.” \n\n\nShe has never shown this but I know she was scared when she realized her symptoms were so similar. She had also smoked her whole life and my uncle had quit over 25 years ago. Her fear became apparent the nights leading up to her scan. In just a month span, she has gone from headaches occasionally to falling down 4 times a day. I’m not sure how fast these things usually happen? (Insight welcome) but it almost appeared as if her fear completely vanished the moment they told her. Kind of a relief almost. She came home in the best spirit, all smiles and just laying her plans out for us. She did talk to hospice (this surprised me) and I know you have to be 6 months or less to qualify. \n\n\nShe has no interest in getting any further test results, any treatment of any kind, the whole 9. This has a lot to do with my uncle, but I’m quickly realizing just how far along she is. In just 4 days, that feel more like 4 weeks honestly, she can no longer walk at all. She has to be carried to the bathroom, she is very confused, she isn’t eating. I’m going crazy at night thinking about how long I have left with her. This seems insanely fast. I know she has been sick sick since at least October… and I hate knowing that fact. Seemed so slow compared to now, tho. I’m assuming that’s the impact on the brain.\n\n\nMy brother and I are trying our best to not only cope ourselves with this volcanic slap in the face, but to cherish our time with her as well as fulfilling all her wishes regarding her will, assets, property, legal stuff. This is so much in such a short amount of time that I am numb. I’m barely functioning in everyday life. I am 23, married with 2 babies under 2 and 2 step daughters. I still rely on my mother every single day for guidance, help, just a listening ear, I text her everyday. I feel as if I’m literally incapable of functioning as an adult, let alone a wife and mother without her help. \nMy brother can’t relate, he’s much older and everything in his life is in order with a backup plan to his backup plan if all else were to fail. \n\n\nI wish I knew about how long we have left with her, but she doesn’t want to know and I respect that. She wasn’t in any pain 2 days ago, just weak.. I skipped yesterday but I’ll see her today. Such a huge difference in her pain over the phone last night. \n\n\nI guess that’s all I have to spit out right now. All over the place, random and useless but that’s all that my brain can put together at the moment. Anyone that listened, thank you.

When I met her, she was in remission. And unfortunately in October 2019, they found it had come back and spread to her brain. The two years after this, mostly during covid, was a mixture of surgeries, chemo and radiotherapy to manage the cancer\n\nAt the start of December 2021, we were given the devastating news that the cancer had grown in the brain and she would have only 6-8 weeks left. This was a conversation between myself and the doctor as my MIL never wanted a timeframe, which we respected. \n\nI then had to share this news with my partner (27M). I\'ll never forget the look on his face. We had our wedding planned for 2023 and wanted her to be there so badly. Within 48 hours I\'d re-arranged the whole wedding to be on the 30th of December 2021, just three weeks after this news. We told my MIL that we were doing this because of the new strain of COVID, that we didn\'t want to get to 2023 and then have to delay it. She was overjoyed and so excited\n\nWe had the most amazing wedding day, she got drunk, had a cheeky cig and danced the night away in her wheelchair that I\'d decorated for her. Two days later she was admitted to hospital. Returning to us two weeks later, then passing away peacefully in her sleep a week later, just over three weeks after the wedding. Again, I had to share that she\'d passed to my husband and the look on his face \n\nThen, a week later I had to take my sister (27F) to A&E after a scan showed serious abnormalities to her eyes. Twelve hours later whilst along in an A&E bed surrounded by screaming people, she was told she had suspected Leukemia. Due to COVID regulations they sought special permission so that I could join her. She was transferred to a specialist hospital and referred to a fertility clinic to start the process of freezing her eggs. My sister has always wanted children. We\'ve since been told that it\'s Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. We had been clinging on to hope that the blood test was wrong. \n\nIn the last 5 days, we\'ve had 3 appointments a day at 3 different hospitals. We\'re lucky, as she\'s stable I\'m allowed to take her and support her \n\nWe\'re still waiting for the detailed results that will tell us what sub-type this is, and then what type of treatment she will need. Either way, treatment starts on the 15th, two weeks after diagnosis. \n\nThrough all of this my now husband has been amazing. I don\'t know how either of us could have gotten through this without each other. But, we\'re lucky we\'re essentially bystanders in other peoples battles. I\'ve tried to keep it together and am trying to stay strong. \n\nMy mother in laws funeral is next week. And we\'ll also be finding out the sub-type around this time. Whatever happens I know we\'ll manage and get through it\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut, I had the test to see if we\'d be a match for stem cells. It\'s a bit tricky because we don\'t know if we\'re identical twins or not (my mum was 15, and we were unexpected twins, so no one actually knows). We\'re going to have DNA test to determine this\n\n1) we could be a match, but identical meaning my stem cells are useless\n\n2) we could be fraternal twins and not a match\n\n3) we could be fraternal twins and a match\n\nI don\'t know how I\'ll cope if the final option isn\'t the given results - how do I cope with this?\n\nI know I\'ll be heartbroken if I can\'t donate. She\'s my twin, she\'s my soul mate. She\'s always been there for me and this is my chance to be there for her\n\nShe\'s the good twin, I\'m the evil on, she doesn\'t deserve this.

Imaging done in the emergency room revealed a pancreatic mass that was obstructing her bile duct. She needed an ERCP to place a biliary stent, during which a biopsy was performed.  \n\nShe was diagnosed with a well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor on or near the head of the pancreas with a KI-67% of 50%. The cancer was also identified in the liver and the gall bladder with two smaller lesions that lit up on the DOTATATE scan. We were referred to a NET specialist at MD Anderson who ordered a more extensive biopsy to confirm the diagnosis before making treatment recommendations.\n\nThe second biopsy altered the diagnosis to poorly-differentiated mixed-acinar neuroendocrine carcinoma with a KI-67% of 80%. The prognosis was also severely diminished; when we asked the crystal ball question, the doctor said most patients live a month to a year with this rare diagnosis. \n\nAfter preparing for something like PRRT or immunotherapy for a well-differentiated NET, my mom went straight into chemo to combat the more aggressive disease she was now diagnosed with. She started on FOLFIRINOX, but after one and a half infusions the irinotecan was dropped due to a recurrent reaction that caused slurred speech and eye twitching. Two weeks ago my mom completed her sixth cycle of FOLFOX, which meant it was time to get her first set of new scans.\n\nThis is what the imaging report said: \n\n>ABDOMEN and PELVIS:\nThe porta hepatis tumor abutting the pancreatic head is smaller, now measuring 1.9 cm, previously 5.1 cm. It no longer obstructs the common bile duct or the IVC\n\n>The liver metastasis in segment IV is smaller, now measuring 4 mm, previously 2.7 cm.\n\n>No other liver metastases seen. There is hepatic steatosis.\n\n>The mass in the gallbladder fundus is smaller, measuring 6 mm, previously 1.3 cm.\n\n>A metallic biliary stent has been replaced. The previously seen biliary dilatation has resolved. Pneumobilia is seen consistent with a patent stent.\n\n>The spleen adrenals pancreas and kidneys are unremarkable.\n\nThis was absolutely wonderful news. When my mom started chemotherapy, we were told the goal was shrinking the tumors and that is what we prayed would happen. But even the doctor seemed surprised by how incredible the results were, with the primary shrinking more than 60% and the other lesions shrinking so much that the doctor had a hard time finding them when he was showing us the imaging. \n\nThis incredible news did bring with it a difficult decision. My mom\'s doctor offered her the choice to keep going with FOLFOX or to drop the super toxic oxaliplatin in hopes of avoiding any permanent neuropathy. My mom had started to feel the neuropathy more consistently since cycles 5/6 and it was starting to affect her lips and tongue in addition to the tips of her fingers and toes. My mom decided to take the break from the oxaliplatin and to put it on the shelf just in case the harsh regimen is needed in the future.

I have an 11 year old son, Andreas, that has AT/RT brain cancer. He was diagnosed in late May 2018. Since then he has received around 200 chemotherapy doses (initially the primary AT/RT protocol treatment, then the medulloblastoma \"MEMMAT\" protocol treatment), over 70 radiation therapies to his brain and spine, undergone several surgeries to remove tumors, and countless MRI scans. The initial surgery in 2018 which removed the primary tumor, made his left hand and leg semi-paralyzed (spastic) and his right eye non-functional (the pupil is always dilated and the movement is not coordinated with the other eye).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDuring the last three years we\'ve received the \"he\'s not gonna make it past the next months\"-message several times. And Andreas fought back. Each time. Metastasis in the spine? Radiation therapy. Metastasis in the brain? MEMMAT protocol with chemotherapy doses administered on average 2.5 times per week for over a year. More tumors in the brain? More radiation therapy, last time was in April 2021. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately, even though he\'s been through hell and back, the cancer still grows. At least 10 tumors spread around the brain is now growing. He\'s starting to lose his ability to speak and swallow, due to a large tumor growing in the cerebellum. We have started with a fairly experimental drug called Tazverik, but the odds are so heavily against him and he is tired. He is currently trying to make peace with the fact that he is going to die very soon and he is saying his last goodbyes to friends and family.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn April 2019, when we received one of the \"you\'re not gonna make it\"-messages from the doctors, a childhood friend of mine (Lasse) who\'s a great musician, wrote a song to Andreas called \"Main man\" and recorded this with his band \"Few Dollars More\". This song has meant the world to Andreas. We listen to it several times a day and it gives us a mix of serenity, peace, melancholy and sorrow. Andreas finds great comfort in knowing that he actually has a song that the world will remember him by. He has requested me to \"write to Reddit\" and ask if they can listen to the song, because it is so important to him to let the world know that this song exists. All profits made from playbacks on Spotify/Tidal/Youtube goes to the The Norwegian Childhood Cancer Organization, so there are no individual profiting from this. Andreas just wants the song to be played for him these last weeks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am asking \"Reddit\" to visit Youtube and listen to his song. I am posting this in several subreddits and I am sorry if I\'m breaking the rules of the subreddit you read this in by asking for views and likes, but right now I\'ve got nothing to lose.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLinks in comments\n\nEDIT - thank you so much for all the wonderful comments and awards and whatnot. I’ve read all the beautiful comments and PM’s I’ve received to him, and he wanted to say thank you to the Reddit community:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/8I26lwQQRzQ\n\nIt’s in Norwegian but he’s saying: “Thank you so much. Thank you so much. I really appreciated.. thanks for all the nice things you wrote to me. That made me happy”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 2 - Andreas loves to hear all your thoughts and comments. He really appreciates them. Thank you all of you. This has been a very good day for him, and each and every one of you have contributed to that. I asked him if he wanted to say something more.

The impending Proctectomy surgery scares me so much because it would be life changing, and in a lot of cases, it takes years to heal. However, I’ll take anything else over cancer.

Im a 22 year old Omani arab medical student. \nMy life had many hurdles. But it wasnt until November 2020 that I met my biggest challenge ever.\n\nMy mother was dx with stage 4 bile duct cancer last November. I was on warrior mode, and my mother was the empress that needed my protection. This is why I joined medicine, to be the shield against all diseases. Boy was I dramatic af.\n\nI did EVERYTHING for her. I FED.I CHANGED CLOTHES. I FOUGHT. I ARGUED. I RESEARCHED. I ASKED. I LEARNED. I PRAYED. I GAVE SADAQAH (charity). \nAnd here I am today. In the emergency department. With my mom. Only this time she isnt full aware of her surroundings. Her mouth open. Her eyes looking dead at the ceiling. Cheekbones exposed. Yellowish tinge of her skin. And involuntary jerks. Just me and her and the music of the machines surrounding us.\n\nShe was supposed to grow old with me. She was supposed to continue being my best friend. But allah made different plans. And I accept that. \n\nDid I mention my grandma died last month? Yes, while my mom was in this state, she had to mourn the death of her own mother, who also died of cancer. But man my granny was tough, she outlived all the “prognostic survival years” and hit the 10 year mark. Sadly, its only been 3 months for my mom.And the angel of death is tapping my shoulder. Warning me of whats to come.\n\nSo here I am, March 25th 2021, sitting right beside my mother, in the emergency department of SQU hospital. Watching this terrible disease suck the life out of her. I must have hugged her and kissed her 15 times , and it kills me to see her out of it, but she pouts when I kiss, because she wants to return the kiss, and I let her.\n\n\nSorry if I made you feel sad dear reader, heres a bit of light. All this pain, all this misery I’m going through . Ill transform it to empathy, respect, discipline and love. I will make sure every patient I touch will feel loved by me, will feel taken cared of by me. I will respect my profession, and give it my due diligence. \n\nThe day my mother passes away, is the day her son will become a great doctor. And allah will bless her with good deeds, because she left behind 3 good human beings who brought mercy upon the human race ( in sha allah ) . \n\nTo all of you going through a similar situation. You are not alone. Turn your pain into passion. And your sorrow into surrendering to the truth. Accept what is happening and do everything you can to make it a bit better. \n\nAs for the rest of you, ill be praying this disease never touches the hairs on your and your loved ones bodies ??❤️ \n\nTake care ??\nPeace be with you all\n\nUpdate 10/4/2021:\n\nGood day everyone,\n\nWith a heavy heart I come to you all 18 days after posting this post . My mother , Roohafza, lost her battle with bile duct cancer on April 10th 2021 at 10:59am.\n\nShe is with our creator and is at peace. She had a smirk on her face an hour after her cardio respiratory systems shut.\n\nFor those of you recently diagnosed with cancer or are caregivers of someone diagnosed with cancer, here are some tips that could help you prepare for your battle. Things I wished my mom did.\n\n1.	⁠Prepare to manage nausea and vomiting. Be very strict with your antiemetics! Take them 30 mins before meals and never left anything interfere with your intake of food and water.\n2.	⁠If you can, move ! Im not saying jog, weight train, or hike. If you can still move, then MOVE ! The moment you stop the cancer will take advantage.\n\nMovement is life. Never stop moving, walking, cooking, dancing , hugging or even doing chores\n\n3) YOUR DIET IS YOUR PROGNOSIS. Make sure your diet is SUPERB. This is not the time to be stingy on your self, buy the best food and eat only the best there is ( to your ability ) .\n\nSoups are easy to digest. Water is key. Veggies are your armor and fruits are your safe shelter .\n\n3) Distract yourself. Dont let cancer be your whole identity. Read! Write ! Pray ! Love ! Produce ! Watch your favorite TV shows, find any excuse to laugh and dance .\n\n4) Balance optimism with being realistic . Being too optimistic could higher your expectations. Learn to know how much to expect. But whether you hear good news or bad news, ALWAYS FOLLOW TIP 5\n\n5) NEVER, EVER ,EVER ,EVER , GIVE UP. You need to show Allah (God), your body , the cancer and all humans that you STILL .HAVE .SOMETHING.TO.LIVE.FOR ! The moment you give up is the moment the cancer starts going beast mode. And with all due respect, you are the beast, not it.\n\nIf there is anything you need, ANYTHING YOU WANT TO KNOW OR ASK !

Before her last hours she had called me to say that she wanted to die. I rushed over to talk to her while she was wincing in pain. I work in the same hospital as where she was admitted so I went to work (930). My dad was already there to comfort her while went to work.\n\nAn hour later (11) my dad had called me saying she wasn\'t doing too well, so I abruptly left work and went to visit her. By the time I came up, they had just administered some dilaudid for her to feel comfortable which she did. At 3, she passed. I watched her with her last breath escaping her body.

Because if covid, one of my major regrets is not being able to spend time with my mom and having my mom see my daughter more. One thing I am grateful for is that my mom helped take care of my daughter when she was born so there was at least some connection. Like I had said in my earlier posts, I do call my mom fairly often and now I have a blank speed dial on my phone. My heart now feels like the is a hole. I took a screen shot of myself to remember how I look after days of sleepless nights receiving phone calls thinking that night would be her last. Now I\'m glad she died peacefully.\n\nI love you mom. I still had many things to ask you and I regret putting that on hold while I was just starting a family.

He cooked for us, danced (he loved dancing), went for walks, and kept running his online business. In early November a CT scan indicated spots on his lung; the cancer had metastasized. After that, it spread incredibly fast all over his head and neck. It got into his jaw, voice box, airways, near his ears, in his upper vertebrae, and likely in his brain. Things got worse after he underwent his first round of chemo and immunotherapy with an experimental drug. His doctors say the treatment made it worse and caused it to spread even faster. He was declining rapidly ever since he finished his first chemo round. \n\nOn Monday he had an ng feeding tube placed (he had a g tube taken out in October because he was able to swallow well). He lost so much weight even though he was getting good calories. He also had a blood transfusion that day because of low hemoglobin counts. The doctors were going to start a new chemo drug in a weeks time. By Monday night he began becoming more delirious and it got worse. Over the next few days he thought he was cooking and eating and drinking; using Kleenex as ingredients and seeing things we couldn’t see. He would be unresponsive for up to 12 hours. He had moments of clarity where he held our hands to his chest and told us he loved us and would meet us in heaven. One of his wishes was that he didn’t want more treatment or to go to the hospital. We thought he’d pass at home but it got so bad Wednesday night that we followed his doctors advice and called an ambulance yesterday morning. We couldn’t take care of him anymore; we tried our best. The EMTs told us he was having a STEMI (heart attack). But we had a DNR order for him. So they made him comfortable and took him to the hospital with my mom.\n\nHe died about three hours after arriving in the hospital. They made him as comfortable as possible. In spite of COVID craziness, they managed to get him and my mom a private room. I said goodbye at home as I wasn’t allowed to come. My mom stayed with him until his final breath. They’d been married 30 years. The doctor was so nice and offered to let me see him once he passed. I told him Thank you, but that I would rather my last moment with him be while he was still alive, squeezing my hand, telling me he loves me. It’s crazy to think that we were enjoying Christmas together (he was on chemo during Christmas, but seemed to be getting better and stable) just a few weeks ago and now he’s gone.\n\nHis last days were absolutely horrible. I had never heard anyone talk about how dreadful the last days can be. I will have nightmares of his pain, suffering, and delirium. I’m so relieved that he is no longer suffering and that he is in a better place. I’ve already starting seeing signs of him. His memory will always live on. But I’m absolutely devastated and heartbroken as I was extremely close to him as he was a stay-at-home dad. I spent most of my life by his side. But I know that he’ll live on with me forever, and I am grateful to have so many lovely memories of him. So many people loved him; the outpouring of love and support has been incredibly touching. Everyone at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre and the UHN - thank you for being so caring and for giving my dad a few months to enjoy life.\n\nMy dad was a Trekkie. He’d come with me to cons to see our favourite scifi actors. I love this quote:\n\n“Picard:\nSomeone once told me that time was a predator that stalked us all our lives. I rather believe that time is a companion who goes with us on the journey and reminds us to cherish every moment, because it will never come again. What we leave behind is not as important as how we\'ve lived. After all Number One, we\'re only mortal.\n\nRiker:\nSpeak for yourself sir, I plan to live forever.”\n\nMy dad was always more of a Riker in this situation, but in the end, I know he felt more like Picard. He even looked a bit like him and dressed as him two Halloween’s ago. I love you and miss you dad. Fuck this horrible, horrible disease. I don’t wish it upon anyone.\n\nRest easy and fly away on your starship.

She doesn\'t do that often, because appointments for me are usually 2-3 times weekly. But she was feeling exceptionally attached today. She sat on my lap this morning. She asked if I would nap with her. She 6, she doesn\'t even nap anymore. But she wanted time with just me, away from the 5 other kids my mom provides daycare for at our house.\n\nInstead, I read to her. I\'m trying to ease her into chapter books. But after one short chapter, I acquiesced to her demand that I read some Bernstein Bears. It hurt to read that long. By the time I was done I was taking long, raspy breaths every few sentences.

I bought myself chocolate, and I got a shirt for my son, a stuffed animal for my daughter, and a candy bar for my husband. I\'m not sure what my goal is here. Is this supposed to ease this news?\n\nA month ago my doctors told me that everything looked clear. No new growth. I wasn\'t expecting that. I thought (at the time) the news was bad. My husband came with me to that appointment. He called my dad on the way home with the good news.\n\nWhen we pulled in, my kids came running out to the car. They were screaming, giddy from the news. We went inside and they could just not calm down. Neither could I. We did a dance party in the kitchen and I gave them ice cream before bed.\n\nBut tge pain and swelling kept getting worse. And here I am, hoping some candy and trinkets will ease the anxiety for my kids. The memory of that night a month ago makes my dread for tonight so much worse.\n\n(30 miles later)\n\nI\'m only 10 minutes from home when I get back in my car.  There is a little place where you can look over the valley of our town. I live on the mountain on the other side.

Maybe if I stall long enough they\'ll be in bed.\n\nAnyway, I should get back in the car.

I never make it long. \n\nI wanted to make a decision about what direction to go before I got home.  I haven\'t. Here is what I have decided: to go on a walk with my husband.

She even said this new chemo is causing barely any symptoms only nausea which goes way with the antisickness tablet. She was discharged from the hospice! She has been out walking every day and has been doing things with the kids, going to the play park and doing art etc. Heck she was even ironing and doing laundry the other day, unassisted!!!! She told me she can feel some of her tumours have actually shrunk (breasts and neck) and the pain is much less in certain areas to the point her syringe driver has been put down to the lowest amount.

I was sitting next to him. His head was on my shoulder. One second he was sleeping, the next he was just\\- gone. It\'s been 7 weeks. 7 incredibly long, miserable, horrible weeks. To say I\'m not handling it well is an understatement, which I guess is what brought me here. My brother always liked reddit. Said it would made him laugh, or forget about problems. I don\'t know, I always thought people online were mostly jackasses (no offense to any here) but I guess my brother just always brought out the best in people. He could find the good in everyone, find the joke in anything, zero in on the people he could horse around with and make everything a party. He always had his sense of humor. His reddit name was photonstravellight, if anyone here knew him. I never even had to make my own account, my brother would cherry\\-pick the best stuff almost every day and send it to me. Made for a lot of laughs. Gonna have to do that myself now, I guess. Even had to go and make my own reddit account for the very first time, which just seemed surreal. I\'m sad, and upset, and angry, and I alternate between wanting to break things and wanting to just sit in the corner and rock myself. My brother didn\'t deserve this. I\'m the asshole, it should have been me. My brother had a future. He was a brilliant physicist. He played a mean fiddle. He was kind, and thoughtful, humble, and genuinely cared about everyone he came in contact with. He was the best person I know. I would gladly take his place. It should have been me. I did 3 tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, I should have been the one to die. Not him. He was by far a better person than I will ever be. At his very core he was a good person. Seeing him struggle through brutal treatments for 2 years and not be able to do a damn thing was a nightmare, but I thought it was a means to an end. I always thought someway, somehow, he would succeed just on sheer stubbornness. And even worse has been to see most of our mutual friends seem like they barely care. They mostly abandoned him when he was diagnosed (including his girlfriend at the time), the very few that stuck around seemed to give up on him in his final few months and mostly stopped talking to him. Then they all pretended like they suddenly cared when he died. And then just carried on with their lives the very next day, like absolutely nothing happened. Like he was just a speed bump in their lives. I always took for granted that having an identical twin meant I\'d have a friend, a shoulder to cry on, someone to have my back, someone to play pranks on, (potential organ donor?)\\- for my whole life. Now I have to face the next 40\\+ years without him. There is not a day that I will not miss him. We were halfway through a bucket list goal of visiting every national park together. I have an unused plane ticket I bought him when we were supposed to go snowboarding last February and I had to cancel because of work. Wish now that I’d told work to kiss my ass and gone anyway. He was supposed to be my best man at my wedding next year. Not in a million years did I think the day would come that I would lose him. His funeral is this weekend, which just promises to reopen all the wounds that haven’t yet closed up. I don’t possess the coping skills for this.

Well it all started back in late October 2020 with abdominal pains in the right flank which were heavy stinging pains that became recurring to the point that on a Sunday night, I had trouble sleeping due to them and thus went to the doctor the next day. Initial thoughts were that I had gallbladder stones and I was given an appointment for an echo scan. And that\'s where the shit hit the fan, during the scanning itself i already noticed something was off when the nurse asked when my prior echo scan had been (I had one a couple years back due to constipation) and she even had to switch scan heads during the exam.\n\nLo and behold, I got a phone call later that day by my doctor that they had found some abnormalities and splotches in the liver. It was then diagnosed as a tumor without a primary tumor, aka,  the liver wasn\'t even the main source. This required me to go in for a CT scan and said scan displayed there there was a thickening in my colon near the spleen and thus I ended up getting a colonoscopy right after Christmas which was concluded with the final results. I have colon cancer and it has spread to the liver.\n\nNow cancer isn\'t a stranger to my family, back in 2013 my Mother was diagnosed with gallbladder cancer after gaining jaundice in May, this turned out to the a final stage symptom and it had already spread through her torso, she passed away in July that year, a few months after we learned what she had, two weeks after the doctors had told us they couldn\'t do anything for her. My uncle, brother of my Mother, was also diagnosed with colon cancer in 2016, he received radiation due to it\'s location as it was located right in the pelvis which made surgery difficult . Radiation sadly backfired and the cancer grew, eventually taking his life. Apparently my grandfather from my Mother\'s side, one that I never met, also passed away from cancer but I have no idea what he had.\n\nSuffice to say, we had our share of cancer in the near family. Thing was, they were all passed around or passed 60 when they got it, here I am 35 (now 36) with a cancer that normally doesn\'t pop up until one\'s 50s and older. So I got the \'luck\' of having a rarity, and on top of that it has a mutation too which is also a rarity. Double whammy.\n\nNaturally, as with most people, I am far from willing to have my life ended so prematurely and thus I accepted getting treatment for this, luckily I live in the Netherlands where health insurance is mandatory and thus I don\'t have to worry about that. We first started in the hospital closest to where I live, about 25 minutes away with a car, and there I started in January with immunotherapy which consisted of being hooked up to the IV for a whole morning followed up by downing pills for two weeks and then one week of rest before the process started anew. \n\nThat was rough, the IV made me nauseous as hell and this feeling remained for about 4 to 5 days. Further more  I had constant fluctuating temperatures that were above what is normal and had a fever every 2 weeks or so which necessitated for me to go to the ER as per the rules and guidelines I was given for this treatment. And since we\'re right in the middle of the Corona pandemic, every ER visit was also a Corona test because of the fever. \n\nAround April I was getting complication from the treatment, I had been losing weight the past months (about 15 kilo/33 lbs) and had even been given nutridrinks due to the nausea leaving me unable to consume food properly for a couple of days. Due to the weight loss the treatment had become too heavy for me as it is calculated by height and weight and since I lost weight I was thusly given too much. This resulted in me becoming even more nauseous, up to the point that I couldn\'t even hold down fluids anymore and I had to be kept at the hospital and hooked up onto a constant IV supplying me with fluids, 3 liters a day for 4 days. It was then also decided that my treatment would be toned down, to 70% of what it first was. And though I remain somewhat nauseous for another week, this did prove to be a turning point and things improved again.\n\nAnd despite all that ruckus, the CT scan that followed showed that the medication was doing it\'s job, the primary tumor in my colon had shrunken significantly and the splots on my liver were becoming more clearer to see. All in all, good news and we decided to continue the treatment for another three months, while I still suffered from temperature fluctuations, things were generally better than the three months prior. Less fevers and thus less ER visits, nausea had even lessened, things were looking good. If only that remained the truth.\n\nThe following CT scan showed that, while the primary tumor had come to the point where it was difficult to find on the images, the ones in my liver were showing no sign of decreasing and some had even grown. Now we\'re talking about miniscule growth here and the doctors generally state this as that the cancer has stabilized, but it was clear that immunotherapy was not going to be doing much better then this. \n\nBecause of the mutation, I was opted for a different treatment in a different hospital, an academic one. Here they were capable of offering treatments and medication my normal hospital did not have access too, but this hospital was further away. about 40 minutes per car. Regardless, you do what you have to do and get things going regardless and I ended up arranging for a cab ride that is paid through my insurance.\n\nNow here, the treatment that I get is one that directly attacks the cancer and I would be on the IV for close to two hours every Thursday while downing new pills every day without pause. Compared to the immunotherapy, this treatment feels a lot milder. No nausea, no fevers, no complications. Heck, even my stamina condition improved as I could actually walk for longer stretches again which was nigh impossible prior. Bi-weekly blood tests also showed improvement and things were going the right way...or so we thought.\n\nI started this treatment in June, I had my last CT scan last September and it showed that, while the situation around the colon had remained the same...so had that of the liver with no significant decrease in the cancer spots. This meant I would not be eligible for surgery because the cancer needs to have decreased to a certain point and in my case it is rather spread out across the liver. This essentially meant it was stable but unlike to improve, in other words, terminal.\n\nNaturally this was a downer for me, especially considering how things had been going. Now I have to say that I have been diagnosed with chronic depression and that a great worry of others was that  having cancer would have quite the effect with that. Except it didn\'t, sure I was saddened by the original diagnosis but I had, and still have, this lust for fighting onwards, to live onwards and my depression was practically gone for a couple of months. Of course once things started to \'normalize\' and become routine, depression would pop up again but it would be just like it always had been. It wasn\'t exactly influenced by the fact I have cancer.\n\nSo even though this was a downer moment, 2 days later I was back to being my usual self and ready to fight on. And so I did, kept going on with my treatment, kept going on with seeing the positive of life. Things have taken a bit of a turn since last week however, as Wednesday I became ill and actually threw up again for the first time in months. The following morning, while I was able to keep liquids down again, I was running a light fever of 38.1/100.58 and had to cancel my treatment for that day. Ever since then I have been fluctuating in temperatures again like I was during immunotherapy but never exactly hitting the fever ranges, just heightened temperature.\n\nLast Thursday I had a talk with my doctor at the hospital and she did some check ups on me, my blood values had increased pertaining the liver, such as the level of bile which had doubled (though she said it could\'ve been due to the paracetamol I\'ve been taking daily) and because my temperature keeps fluctuation, she wans me to have blood tests done again next week as well as a new CT scan, of which the latter\'s results I wont get until a week after that.\n\nNow of course this can have multiple reasonings, where I live there has been some sickness going around and my dad had been throwing up days prior as well as that I visited a household on a day where another one was throwing up (this was two days before I started), so I might have just gotten a stomach bug and because my immune system isn\'t the best, I\'m just dragging on with being sick. \n\nIt could also be the medication that I take, which is something the doctor noted on. And of course, it could also be the cancer it self...which is the least favorable conclusion.\n\nSo I am sitting here, despite trying to be positive, despite trying to laugh it off, despite all of that....there\'s that voice in the back of my head and it is whispering, oh it is whispering. I hate it, I utterly hate it and I will have to wait weeks before I get a conclusive result, unless it is actually bad and then I\'ll probably be informed sooner, but even then I\'m still waiting more than a week because the CT scan and blood tests aren\'t until next Thursday.\n\nI\'m sitting here, with that nagging little whisper, this could be my final year. This could be my last Christmas, I could have had my last Birthday a couple months back. And I am not ready yet, I am not ready to accept that. I know that this damned disease will kill me, I know I wont grow old but I would at least like to try and keep up for maybe a few more years, maybe hit my 40th birthday at best.\n\nIn any case....this has been a long story, thank you for reading it all through.

I was diagnosed with advanced cancer over a year ago.  The last year has been full of pain, fear, struggle, anger, sadness, depression....but also small periods of joy.  I have spent the year getting to know myself. better.... Exploring Qi Gong, writing, painting, hiking in the woods, and helping my mother with her vegetable garden.\n\nI have been very afraid of death.  I have been scared for the past 14 months.  I have been traumatized from treatment: 33 sessions of being strapped to a metal table and having my face radiated, of a 17 hour craniotomy, of high dose chemo, of losing my sense of smell permanently and dealing with double vision for the past 14 months.  But everything post treatment had been good.  My last 3 MRI scans were clean, but the fear was still there.....what if there is a recurrence? how am I ever going to go back to work?  How will I ever see normally again?  How will I ever enjoy eating again without smelling?  The struggle has been real and has not been getting better as time goes on; But I have tried to take it one day at a time and to find small ways to try to make things better.\n\nThen about 3 weeks ago (when I was just starting to get back to a new normal), I had a seizure.  It scared the hell out of me.  I thought it was the end....I didn\'t tell anyone about it.  Then it happened again a week later, put me on my back with a Grand Mal.  I went to the ER.  They did a CT.  Said everything looked normal.  I didn\'t feel right about that diagnosis so I contacted my care team and they said you need a Brain MRI....long story short: the MRI showed that I potentially have mets on my brain and they want to biopsy it to see for sure. Perhaps there are treatment options--but I am not in denial.  I know this may be a recurrence--I may be nearing the end of my journey....I don\'t know.  Nobody ever knows, right?\n\nI share this in the hopes of others in this space who have found grace in their struggles.  The really odd thing is after the seizures, the ER and the MRI showing possible mets....I would have thought it would put me over the edge with fear and worry but the opposite has happened: I feel at great peace. I have spent the past week getting my affairs in order and feeling happier than I have since I was first diagnosed, 14 months ago.  I have no idea why....Perhaps it is the Zoloft I started recently :)\n\nBut in all seriousness....I feel like my ability to cope has improved. I feel I have accepted my own mortality, finally. I am no longer afraid.  And damnit...I am going to live my best life for however long I have left.  Whether that be 2 months, 2 years, or 40 more....For others in similar boats: did you find a similar experience?  As in once you truly faced your mortality and accepted that you really have very little control over it all; that you were at peace and found clarity and a weird sense of calm.  Maybe I am just crazy.  I don\'t know.....\n\nThanks for letting me rant on here.  I know it is long and meandering.  The struggle is real but I just hope I can find grace in it all.

Never felt like I was close to hurling the entire time.  \n\n28 rounds of radiation which burned the esophagus pretty good and made some things difficult to eat.  \n\nI got a feeding tube(G tube) which I HIGHLY recommend.  Yes it’s a pain in the ass but it takes the pressure off trying to eat while a tumor is preventing you from doing it easily.  As radiation progressed the tumor shrank and it was easier to eat so I used the tube less and eventually not at all.  If you’re on the fence about the tube, get it. \n\nHad an esophagectomy two weeks ago and am now home recovering.  The pain really hasn’t been bad.  Was in the hospital a week but it probably would have been out two days sooner if I hadn’t developed pneumonia in one lung.  Started soft foods this week and am now doing overnight feedings via a J tube directly into my small intestines.  \n\nOverall, I thought it would be an awful summer due to treatment and it did suck but also wasn’t nearly as bad as I thought it would be.

( so please no suggestions re- treatment options, i think i just need to vent to you who truly understand ) \n\nWent abroad to my homecountry for treatment of and on over the past 2 years , went to germany for private treatment and spend all our savings, and managed to stop the lymphnodes growing but since covid & no traveling + to risky for him he’s slowly doing worse. Every 3month’s scan there’s something new. First it was the new mets to peritoneum, then his liver, last week several new bits on his liver. \n\nSince march he’s had long hospital stays, stent fittings, mistery infections and mistery bleeds since march. \n\nWe have good contact with the cancer ward & oncologist, the gp ( docter) and the palliative team. Hell im even recieving counselling. ( my counselor is my little saviour, if it wasn’t for my weekly sessions with her i wouldnt know how i could hold on any longer without breaking down completly) .\n\nI see him deteriourating infront of my eyes, my sweet beautiful husband. He is the love of my life. I left my mum and friends to move to his home country , then 4 years ago my mother suddenly got lung cancer and we flew over to stay with her and as an only child ( my father passed away off cancer when i was young) i moved in with her and died within a space of 4 months. Me and him looked after her untill she passed away. He tucked her in and gave her her hotwater bottles. He is the only one in this world i share these memories about mum with. Hes the only one that truly gets how it was . \n\nWe were going to go for ivf treatment after i’d finish my degree that i went head into after mum died , but then he got diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma and had i to break off my study and job and slowly move into his business and help out. He’s had an 11 hour surgery at the start of his diagnose ( we got married 3 days before!! 12 years together though) and outcome with no clear margin unfortunatly. He’s been through so much. His poor poor body. \n\nHes starting to look simulair as mum, the painmeds, the dizzy spells, the more and more sleeping , its killing me inside every second of every day. The signs of his liver not working properly anymore are slowly coming ( oncologist is aware, he gets weekly bloods & check ups ) and im so scared for the next thing to come. For the next ‘fase’ . \n\nI can’t describe this feeling but its adrenaline for anything that could go wrong at any moment ( we had a few close calls over the past few months & his docs have said he is to weak & he has a no rescusitation advice in place ) mixed with just utter sadness of seeing the love of my life slowly wasting away. The realisation of not having a future together anymore has come. It is like we are stuck in some sort of time-less bubble.\n\nHe still has hope that he will stay stable for a long time, and when i chat to him i still feel that hope too, but when i’m alone i don’t . Its a horrible feeling that has seeped in, the hope for a miracle is slowly slipping when i am alone. All i see are signs that its nót going so well and that i really truly might actually are going to loose him. \nIt breaks my heart he is still his ever lasting , sweet positive self and never complains even though he is in pain. I fucking hate this cancer so so much . \n\nI hate peoples reactions, im hiding from our friends atm, the questions, the texts, its to much . I know everyone means well but it drains the shit out of me. Im so fucking tired. The ‘update on scan’ chat groups, i copy paste so its not much work, but even that i have to force myself to do and dread everyones responses. \nIm not the same anymore. I’v changed into a miserable person that just feels hurt and deserted and angry at the world. Im not the same empathetic, bubbly arty girl i once was. \n\nI can’t stand opening social media and seeing ‘woo me’ posts about peoples stupid problems, or about them telling about their fucking grandma that was 98 and lived a long and healty life and how “ she had cancer too so they know what your going through “ . \n\nI think i feel jalousy when i see people that are way older then me & still have both their parents, a large family , security of family around etc. Most my friends are having kids & looking into houses at this stage of their lives. \n\nWe have given everything over the past 3 years, so many treatments , trips back and forward to my country for complementairy treatments and every single day revolving around doing something to keep him as healthy, as loved and has cared for as possible. Im running a business that has never been mine and its a tiny business but never the less scary. We are in the process of finalising paperworks so if shit hits the fan things are easier to deal with, but its making all this horribly realistic. \n\nIts making me realise that there is a very big chance i am going to end up alone here, in our super rurol village away from our friends and my home country where my best friends are and i feel awfull for even letting those thoughts cross my mind :( like i am giving up on my husband :(\n Im not, i wont ever leave his side and im his bedside special sexy nurse and i will fight tooth and nail to keep him going for as long as he wants with whatever means we have got. \n\nI’v been a lurker on here for quite some time, but its 3 pm right now , my mind is racing and i just need to get this of my chest .

For dinner we did one of his favorites, chicken Cesar salad, he had a few bites and an ensure. He had a bathroom incident where I had to get him to the shower, I’m a small girl and he was very weak so this was kinda a traumatic situation. He was extremely out of it afterwards and he never wanted my sisters or I to have to do something like that. I can’t help but blame myself and this situation on his later passing. A few minutes after he was back in bed he was back to talking to me and took his medication without issue. He was very weak but drank his water bottle all on his own which was a struggle on some days. I decided to stay in his bed with him because of his bathroom issues so I could be right there to help. He told me “sasha, you did good” which was reassuring at the time but was definitely something out of the ordinary for him to say. I held his hand and/or kept a hand on him all night. I managed to stay awake till 2:30am watching him. I awoke at 3am and he was ok, still next to me and still breathing. I awoke a 4am to find him on the floor. We are pretty sure he passed in bed and fell after because he kinda lays over the side. His bed is very close to the ground for his safety. I flipped him on to his back, it took two tries and at this point I knew he was gone because he made that weird exhale sound. I was screaming “wake up dad, wake up dad” over and over, I was not ok. I called 911 and checked for a pulse and did chest compressions. Emt and police came, they confirmed that he had passed away as I had already known. Since I have power of attorney they allowed me to declare him as DNR with the dnr sticker on our advanced directive, this allowed him to stay in our home. Family was able to come and I was able to lay with him and talk to him for hours. Hospice arranged pick up. This was 100% the hardest part. I didn’t want him to go. I couldn’t handle him leaving. My boyfriend held me close so I couldn’t watch, my sisters talked with me and they all reassured me. I had to be strong for them, I had to be strong for my dad. \n\nThank you all for reading this.

We got together in early 2012.  I’ve known her since freshman high school. She is 32.  I am 31.  It’s unfortunate that we did not get together sooner.  In 2014-15 we notice she had urine issues and back pain and leg pain.  The doctors we were seeing thought it was just sciatica or kidney stones.  \n\nIn June of 2016 she goes into kidney failure. The doctors state something is very wrong and not normal. When he went in for surgery the urologist notice something “not normal” (cervical tumor pushing on her ureters) kidney stints get installed.  He gives us recommendations for an oncologists. We go and after the biopsy our worst fear became reality.  Stage 4 cervical cancer.  \n\n3 months (I don’t remember how long) of radiation and taxol chemo goes on.  Doctor thinks this should take care of everything and get a check up after 3 months.  (Worst decision imho) we go in for check up and bad news and good news.  \n\nThe cervical tumor got smaller.  Bad news.  Something bad along the way and it went into lymph nodes in her neck and sternum.  Chemo continues on but with different kind of chemo( not taxol) and pretty much continues till Novemberish or so.  Each pet scan/ct scan was never great. Best case was tumor never got bigger or smaller.  Doctor said “in the medical world, that is a great sign.” And chemo should continue on.   Waiting on insurance to approve another round. \n\n(Chemo hasn’t started.)\nAfter thanksgiving my wife starts throwing up and having serious nausea.  Zofran(spelling) is not helping. She can’t keep down her meds.  She gets admitted to the hospital.  They find out she has an obstruction in her colon( pretty much tumor is blocking things) \n\nShe gets let out of the hospital after maybe 2 weeks.  She stays in my apartment. She’s doing fine for a couple days. She calls me up saying she has been having trouble breathing because so much vomit etc. I take her back to the hospital.  (This is either after christmas or not. But she did get to celebrate Christmas with us)\n\nIt’s confirmed she has pneumonia.  She is there for another couple weeks to make sure nothing goes bad. We are making preparations to see doctor for more pet scans.  It’s been almost 2 months of no chemo treatment due to being in and out of hospital.   Results show everything grew and now things have gone to her lungs and spine. Oncologist says no reason to continue.  She is now terminal.  Plans for hospice care is in the work. \n\nIt’s January. Hospice care is going on. Somewhere along the way while she was in the hospital the doctor decides a gastrointestinal tube should be done.  To relieve her of nausea. Tho she is limited to liquids.  This was the best out of her 4 options given to her. And it became the best.  She has never had any nausea since.  \n\nShe has been staying at her parents house. Her parents are retired and have been taking great care of her. The hospice company has been great.  \n\nA month ago we notice she can no longer stand/walk or move her legs. To go to the restroom.  We don’t know if this apart of atrophy or something related to cancer. Regardless we have to now fully take care of her.  We have to change her and clean her and do everything. \n\nA week ago. Hospice recommends 24 hour care. During this time her mental status has been so altered from the morphine it’s like she isn’t the same.  Last Friday starts where she is in respiratory distress. Having high rate of breathing and a huge drop in blood pressure. On call nurse stabilize her thru more meds to calm her and up get portable o2 thru nasal cannula to 5.  (Was 4 with a huge tube length- now shorter )\n\nNow she’s been having Cheyen stokes breathing since Friday.  I overheard the nurse. Use the term “terminal breathing”\n\nIt’s very hard to see.

Even though everything but that was going downhill my school work had always been the most important thing to me and not once did I let that priority slip. I was getting consistent grades and everyone close to me was proud. \n\nSecond term was a bit of a blur as I was hardly at school, I was drained by what was going on in my body. I didn\'t see many people and I felt very depressed. \n\nBy term three I had started chemo and my newly titled boyfriend attended as many four hour long sessions as he possibly could. We would sit together on the chair and play super smash bros against one another. I always beat him and I believed that he wasn\'t letting me. Things became complicated with us as his parents told him that I was a toxin in his life, if he became too attached to me he was likely to plummet once I was gone. They forbid him from talking to me and so began the slow descent on the one thing that made me happy. During that time there were some lovely things happening though. My mother had gotten a new job that she is currently enjoying immensely, my friends made a special speech for me at our awards night (which made me cry very hard and I was a mess when I received two academic awards), and I\'d been on a trip to Brisbane with a class of kids from my grade. We had an amazing time together, getting to know one another. But it was on that trip that I had found out my grade II had progressed quickly to grade IV. When I arrived home my mother was a mess. After a few more processes of chemo we were forced to shave my head and it became extremely easy to style in the morning. Between then and now there have been many highs and many lows. \n\nLast night, was my year 12 formal (http://imgur.com/gBR2xg5). It was the best night of my life so far and I just felt like a normal teenager again, dancing and singing with all my friends. I felt beautiful, something I hadn\'t felt since February. And now with only a week left of school I\'m starting to realise the importance of time. A few weeks ago I was told I only had until after Christmas to live and well, I\'m not really prepared to be gone. I still have so much I want to do but I won\'t ever get to do those things. Like travel to Europe, be a mother or even an auntie, be a godmother to my friend\'s children, or see my brother graduate and grow up to be the loveliest man in the world. These things are becoming a reality to me now and I\'d like to make sure everyone understands just how precious your time here is. \n\nMy journey has been draining and sad but not once did I forget that I was still on this earth and I had to live my life. My friends and family have tried very hard to keep me smiling throughout the year and I\'m so grateful for them.

I never realized everything centered around other people\'s experience with cancer. you cannot easily find a support group for people who only have cancer. how odd is that? \n\nwhen you have cancer I suppose everyone is your caregiver. is my mom still my caregiver? she works so I mostly threw up by myself all day while on radiation. she makes my step dad dinner every night - he\'s healthy. is she his caregiver? she washes his clothes and goes shopping for him. am I inherently more burdensome because I\'m ill? was I my grandmother\'s caregiver when I just visited her and hung out? some are really caregivers, of course. but the term is overused, imo. some people are relatives, or friends. I am taking care of myself, I\'m left to fend for myself. \n\nI\'ve learned that cancer is a balancing act of what to say. don\'t talk about the bad side, in a cancer support group or with friends or with strangers - that\'s negativity. your suffering is scaring people. no one likes to think about that. grief posting is fine though. cancer is sad and people have to get it off their chest.\n\nI have watched people so many times tell those with cancer that they need to stop crying. they need to get a grip and grow up and move on. I don\'t advise that we should all wallow in it. but when are the grieving supposed to move on? do you respond the same way to them? I read that said someone was my age and they felt it was not fair that their loved one was dying. after all, they said - they were only my age! not supposed to lose a loved one when you\'re that young. their life is over, it\'s unlived. I don\'t disagree it\'s very sad and needing of support somewhere. but it\'s an interesting thing to read when you are the same age, the one who will die relatively soon, the one who will not live that life and are regularly told: your life is not over, stop saying it is. you are making a big deal out of things. why are you even sad about this? you need to move on, and pretend you are not dying, until you do die. When I posted about how I do not feel particularly lucky to be dying at the same age I got a response that duh - stupid cancer patient - they are saying you are lucky that you will not die in 3 weeks! be grateful! I\'m simply surprised that attitude is not extended to those who are not ill at all. \n\nmost days I hate that cancer is such a cultural Thing. I struggle to think of the perfect analogy. I don\'t know if there is one. but people die, parents die, grandparents die. I\'m not arguing that it isn\'t terrible and upsetting. but it is odd to me that people with a disease have to exist in spaces where people are allowed to flit by and say \"x died from this specific thing and it was so terrible. your disease is terrible and deadly.\" don\'t people regularly complain of saying \"omg, x died of cancer!\" why is it so different in a support setting where most are vulnerable?\n\npatients are not handled with the same kid gloves. when they are, it is seen as unfair coddling to those around them, seen as exclusionary. everyone has a right to be as involved in your cancer as you are - and if you have a complaint, a rant? the classic line: they only want the best. my mom today complained about how my grandmother\'s oncologist spent all his energy on the patients. I had a bit of an internal laugh about that one. \n\nI know that it\'s awful to have a loved one die and I know caregiving is not easy. but you don\'t know what it\'s like unless you have it. you don\'t have the right to say treatment is easy when you haven\'t been through it. I\'ve been called cruel for literally simply speaking about \'a grim and deadly disease\' and saying that treatment is in fact, not fun or easy - by someone who did not have said disease. I\'m certainly aware that it\'s grim. though if I called my own disease that I am sure I would get many responses that stats are outdated and useless, and I may live forever. my question there is this: if treatment is so easy and painless, why do you describe yourself as a caregiver? do healthy non suffering people need caregivers? if survival rates are so outdated and do not apply to anyone, why are you mourning in advance? if having cancer is so terrible for everyone around me, why is it not terrible for me to have it? \n\nI remember being a very depressed young teen and having a really dark thought: I wish I had cancer. I wish people understood I was suffering. If I had some illness they would understand, they would empathize with me. It wouldn\'t all be in my mind. As I grew up I mostly realized that was bs. But you really don\'t realize how lonely cancer is until you have it. some days I miss being alone in my suffering without people thinking they understood and speaking on my behalf.\n\nI don\'t disagree that caregivers ever come to cancer spaces, fwiw. I appreciate when people are seeking to help a loved one with diet choices or pain relief. And I understand that it\'s devastating to watch someone go through something terrible. there definitely needs to be support for all. My dad is disabled and suffering and thinking of it makes me instantly cry. I do things for him a lot. I just cannot imagine going to an amputee support group and going up to the mic and saying \"hey, so I still have all my limbs, but I just wanted to explain that watching you go through this is really hard for me. It makes me very miserable to think about how you guys are suffering. I also know someone who died from amputation, and it was very terrible to watch. But you guys should be strong and get through this! I\'m here to answer questions because actually my dad had it really easy, he never even cried to me! Ta.\" \n\nidk. as I\'ve said, I don\'t think we should be told to wallow in our misery. but I often feel pretty gaslighted - if everyone around me is suffering by virtue of watching me suffer... how am I lucky? are they not lucky too? after all, their loved one could die in 6 months - some have 3 weeks! pick your head up. I feel like if I said that to the grieving parent I\'d be pretty immediately knocked down a peg, and rightly so. \n\nI doubt anyone will read this all and if anyone does I\'m sure I will be met with a lot of disagreement, but whatever. I\'m grateful for the kind people I\'ve met. this isn\'t particularly coherent because I have so many thoughts on it all. I speak for myself but I will say I find it funny that if you go to a chat, people will largely say they do not check support groups anymore. I just wanted to say my peace before I prob leave this area or take a break at least because no place feels made for patients, at all. Maybe that\'s cruel.

Sorry for the long post\n\nLike the title says he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer on January 29th after experiencing a series of symptoms starting around new year. Early symptoms were vomiting, struggling to eat, he described a feeling of a blockage and pain to the back and abdominal area. Over the first few weeks of the year they tried enemas, laxatives and managing the vomiting. That was until they finally got round to doing scans and saw a growth on the pancreas. \n\nWe went to the hospital on the 29th not knowing what they would say. My dad was in alot of pain that day. The meeting with the doctor still feels like yesterday. I remember my dad asking if it was terminal but the doctor just replied with how he doesn\'t like that word and how something can be done for everyone. Anyway my dad was admitted to the hospital for a couple of weeks so they could get him stable and eating again. \n\nHe seemed close to normal in the hospital after a day or so and was like that until he came home. This is where I started to look after him. What I got to see at this point is how bad he would get throughout the night. The medication he was on only seemed to work until around 2 in the morning. Then the pain seemed to go upto 11. He would cry out in pain and want a hot water bottle. One at first but we had to get a second as it wasn\'t enough. Now a quick warning. I dont know if it was the cancer or the pain killers but my dad would put them under his back and they would burn him without us knowing. That was until one day i checked his back and it was brown and patterned. \n\nOver the time i looked after him the pain became worse and so did his symptoms. I would say the key changes were becoming less interested in food again, sleeping throughout most of the day, easily confused, nodding off during doing tasks and becoming weaker and weaker. That was until he took bad one night and was sick bile for the first time. The day after he was admitted into hospital again as he was very confused and in pain. He had too much calcium in the blood and a stomach blockage. \n\nHe was in hospital for around a week as they levelled out his blood levels and sorted out the blockage. He was alright enough to discharge again on the Wednesday but that day would be the last day he would eat. \n\nHe was home for 3 days before he started to vomit bile and he was screaming in pain. So on the Sunday morning an ambulance came and he wad admitted into hospital for the last time. This time the doctors just thought it was a gallbladder infection. Talked about getting my dad better and discharge him. Oh yeah he still had months left they told us. So the doctors got my dad stable again but he wasnt eating and pain was still a problem.\n\nOver the next few weeks the weight just fell off my dad and he couldn\'t even be awake some days when I visited. Other days he would be very angry and grumpy. Then one day he fell in the shower and the next he was in the hospice. \n\nFirst couple of days he seemed okay. We chatted when he could. Then again on Wednesday he took ill and was sick more bile. It was the first time he looked like he was dying. He was stick thin and i could see his heart beat through his t shirt moving. \n\nThe hospice thought it was a blockage in the stomach or gallbladder and tried to fix it. They also tried to put a tube down my dads nose into his stomach but since he had a broken nose a few years ago, they couldn\'t. That was the last day my dad was fully aware. They put him on a morphine drip and that was it until the Sunday. \n\nHe was responsive until the weekend. Even if you could only get a few words of conversation for the entire visit. I got the dreaded phone call last Monday morning, the 2nd of April. By the time i got there he had just gone. \n\nI know going through cancer is not easy for anyone. I did all i could but i still regret getting frustrated at my dad when he was grumpy. I felt bad on the days where i needed to get out for a bit for my own sake and leaving him. But remember that cancer changes all that it touches, even if we are just the ones left caring or picking up the pieces. Do whatever you need to do to get through it. There is no textbook on how so dont be afraid to ask for help like i may have been. Trust your gut, doctors can be wrong about how long is left so just take each day as it comes. Lastly, if your loved ones personality does change, remember that they still love you and that the cancer is just causing them alot of pain, confusion and is a massive hit to mental health anyway. This is evident as even though my dad was grumpy or sleeping when I saw him, when others visited he told them to look after me after hes gone. Remember that it will pass. It felt like forever going through it but now this year has flown over. \n\nThank you for reading this. It was alot longer than I thought it would be. But it feels good to get it off my chest.

Now I\'m at the stage where I\'m on Tamoxifen and having CT scans every three months (it will be 1 year since my last chemotherapy at the end of March this year). I\'ve had a single breast mastectomy (left breast and nipple plus 21 lymph nodes of which only 2 were affected removed), then chemotherapy and lung resection last March for kidney cancer that had spread to my left lung (childhood cancer that came back 20 years later). I haven\'t had reconstruction because my surgeon had told me that they didn\'t have a specific plan for treatment after the mastectomy because I had two cancers and history with previous chemotherapy and radiation in the chest area, so it would be too complicated to do reconstruction at that point without knowing exactly what I\'d have to do later. So I let it go at that point and agreed to do it later. However, I\'m 31 years old and I\'m not sure I could live for the rest of my life without some sort of reconstruction at this point in life.\n\nMastectomy was late September 2020. Now that it has been over a year since then, and hopefully my lung is completely healed by now in order to have another surgery, I\'m really thinking about talking with a surgeon about reconstruction again. My oncologist and breast care nurse warned me that I should take my time because it\'s a long and physically and mentally demanding process, and I had a lot of stuff done in a relatively short amount of time (like all cancer patients, of course). I will have to have some sort of surgery on the other breast as well as my breasts were/are an AA cup or even less than that. I\'m skinny and besides having not enough fat/tissue on my abdomen and back for flaps, I have old scars (from my childhood cancer) on both areas so they couldn\'t be used for that even if I did. One idea was that they would try for a TUG flap, but I really really would want to avoid that (to the point where if that\'s my only option, I\'m not going to do reconstruction at all) as I have over 15 scars all over my torso and would really hate to have another one on my legs. The plastic surgeon I had seen in 2020 was sceptical about doing implant reconstruction because my left breast had been irradiated back in 1999 for lung metastasis. But I would obviously prefer to have implants, the smallest size available, with or without expanders.\n\nMy apologies for the long story, but I wanted to ask those of you that by chance did a delayed single reconstruction what you decided on at the end; how long did you wait after your mastectomy to visit the plastic surgeon and go ahead with the surgery? If you had radiation, was implant-based reconstruction an option for you? Were you happy with the results? I have an appointment with my oncologist for my latest CT scan results and I\'m thinking of bringing it up this time, but I\'m not sure if it would be a good idea to go through reconstruction while I\'m still having CT scans every three months and there is a chance that I\'m not completely in the clear yet.',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Delayed single breast reconstruction timing and outcomes',NULL,6,1,'https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/sh8fvm/delayed_single_breast_reconstruction_timing_and/',NULL,NULL,NULL),(NULL,NULL,3229,'nfymf',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,4250,'sgy7k5',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Patient',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Testicular cancer, does anyone else care about balls?
